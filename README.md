C++ routines for local and global computations with integer-valued quadratic forms


These routines compute local densities (at all places) for
integer-valued quadratic forms and check representability of all
numbers up to a given (multiplicatively defined) bound. These
computations produce the explicit (sharp) lower bound for the constant
in the asymptotic expression for the "representation numbers" r_Q(m)
described in the 2004 Duke Math. Journal paper of Hanke "Local
Densities and Explicit Bounds for Representability by a Quadratic
Form".
