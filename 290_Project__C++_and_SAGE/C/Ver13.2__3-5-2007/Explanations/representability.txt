Representability class:
=======================

This class is where most of the other code comes together to find
*all* exceptions of a positive definite integer-valued quadratic form
in 4 variables.  While its inner-workings are complicated and embody
the general "analytic method" for finding all exceptions, it has only
a constructor and a GetExceptions() method, which returns the vector
of exceptions.
