LocalSplitCoverings class:
==========================

This class computes and stores a list minimal local split coverings of
a positive definite quaternary quadratic form Q, by which we mean a pair
(d, T) of a number (unary form) d and a ternary form T whose
orthogonal sum agrees with the Q on some sublattice and has the same
local conditions as Q.   The statement of being minimal means that d
is incrementally chosen to be as small as possible.  (These local split
coverings are very useful for quickly checking representability of
large numbers Q.  See XXX for more details.)

      Quaternary info:
      ----------------
        Big_Form -- returns Q
	Big_Local -- gives the local conditions of Q

      Covering info:
      --------------
        multiplicity() -- gives the number of covers currently known
        Get_Form (cover_number, form_number) -- returns the ternary T for this cover
	Get_Value (cover_number, form_number) -- returns the number d for this cover
	Get_Local_Conditions (cover_number, form_number) -- returns the local conditions for the pair (d,T)
	size(i) -- This say how many pairs are used in the i-th cover,
		   which should always be 1.

      Misc:
      -----
	IncrementLocalSplitCoverings() -- adds the next smallest split cover to the list


Note: These were originally set up to use several split sublattices
whose local conditions collectively agree with Q (i.e. every number
locally represented by Q is locally represented by at least one pair
(d,T)), but we found that one form always sufficed.  Therefore the
"form_number" above is always taken to be 1.
