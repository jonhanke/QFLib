QuaternaryExceptions class:
===========================

This class finds all exceptions < X of a (positive definite) quaternary
quadratic form Q by comparison with the theta function of Q.  It can
also take a set of numbers (possible exceptions), and say which of
them are exceptions. 

Note: This class still needs to be cleaned up, and originally used
several methods (Jagy's method also) for finding large exceptions.
