PowerSeries<T> class:
=====================

This is a fairly generic power series class which makes power series
of any type T, and does basic arithmetic, coefficient operations,
comparison, and file I/O.  The precision is defined in the
constructor, which is either explicitly given, or comes from a the
size of the vector of coefficients.
