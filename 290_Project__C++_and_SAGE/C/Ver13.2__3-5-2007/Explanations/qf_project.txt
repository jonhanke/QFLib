QF_Project class:
=================

This class finds the individual and common exceptions of a list of
forms, which are stored in a datafile together wtih the relevant cusp
constants for their theta functions.  The constructor takes a project
name (which defines an individual project folder), a formfilename
(which has a list of forms and their cusp constants), and a set of
form numbers describing forms to ignore (nubmered from 1 in the order
given in the form file).
